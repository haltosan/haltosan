- 👋 Hi, I’m @haltosan
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security, high level abstraction, logic, and learning (the kind you do in school, not what computers do).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software design principles. I'm also working on algorithm design, proofs, and Microsoft's language Lean.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on refactoring projects (to give me design experience) or security projects.
