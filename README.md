- 👋 Hi, I’m @haltosan
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security, logic, and learning all I can (and helping computers learn too).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write testable and maintainable projects. I'm also learning Haskell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on refactoring projects (to give me design experience) or security projects.


Also, if anybody has seen Dilithium and/or Falcon (new post-quantum cryptography standards), I would love to hear about where it was and what it was used for. I'm doing research right now.
